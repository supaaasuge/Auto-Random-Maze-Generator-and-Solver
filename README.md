# Auto-Random-Maze-Generator-and-Solver
Pseudorandom (deterministric, i.e., maze will  always start and end at the same two points) maze generator + solver. To solve the maze, currently it just brute force's the maze pretty much. However the end goal of this project is to implement the A* pathfinding algorithm successfully. 

TODO:
- Docs
- Add A* (fix beta vs)
- Optimize/speed improve maze drawing/generation.
- Refactor a lotta shit. All of it to be more specific...
  - Im lazy + works for me so...
    - Too ez

## Usage
```bash
python3 maze.py
```

###### Requirements
- `tkinter`
- `random`
- `time`
- `threading`
